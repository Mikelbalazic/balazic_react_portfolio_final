# balazic_react_portfolio

In this challenge, we were asked to make a comprehensive react portfolio. The portfolio highlights our skills, features our past work, provides a personal description of ourself, and allows users to contact us in future. The challenge was very exciting in that it showed a different method to combine front-end components and how it could be later married with back-end workflow. I am very happy with the end results of this project and I believe it highlights my skills as a front-end developer and designer.
